Dat Huynh is a Ph.D. student at Khoury College of Computer Sciences, Northeastern University, advised by [Prof. Ehsan Elhamifar](https://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/eelhami/). 
He always ponders upon the question of low-shot learning as the direction toward minimal supervision for machine learning. 
To tackle this challenge, he leverages [computer vision techniques](https://hbdat.github.io/publication/) such as attention mechanism, self-supervised learning and generative models with the hope of mimicking human ability to extrapolate beyond what have been learned.
