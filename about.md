Dat Huynh is a Ph.D. student in the Computer Science program at Northeastern Universityâ€™s  Khoury College of Computer Sciences, advised by Professor Ehsan Elhamifar. He works on zero-shot, few-shot, large-scale semi-supervised multi-label learning. His goal is to leverage information from different domains and seek regularity between different tasks to minimize human annotation effort and generalize to unseen taks. He uses tools from deep learning, sparse coding, attention models to address these problems.
