## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="profile_pic.jpg">

Hi, I am a Ph.D. candidate at Khoury College of Computer Sciences, Northeastern University, advised by [Prof. Ehsan Elhamifar](https://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/eelhami/). 

I received my B.S. from University of Sciences (Viet Nam) where I was fortunate to study in Advanced Program in Computer Science. 

## Research Interest
My main interest is on reducing the amount of annotation needed to train deep learning systems.
I am mesmerized by how much a machine can learn with a few, one, or zero training sample(s).

I am currently working on:
+ Interpreting and controlling machine predictions via novel attention mechanisms
+ Leveraging human knowledge in textual domain to recognize unseen concepts

## News
+ New paper on ```Self-Supervised Multi-Task Procedure Learning from Instructional Videos``` is accepted to [ECCV 2020](https://eccv2020.eu/) and the code is available at [Github](https://github.com/hbdat/eccv20_Multi_Task_Procedure_Learning)
+ Codes from the CVPR20 papers are released on [Github](https://github.com/hbdat).
+ Attended [virtual CVPR20](http://cvpr2020.thecvf.com/). Kudos to the organizers for pulling this off.
