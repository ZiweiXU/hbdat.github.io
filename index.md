## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="sherlock.jpg">

Hi, I am a Ph.D. candidate at Khoury College of Computer Sciences, Northeastern University, advised by [Prof. Ehsan Elhamifar](https://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/eelhami/). 

I received my B.S. from University of Sciences (Viet Nam) where I was fortunate to study in Advanced Program in Computer Science. 

## Research Interest
My main interest is on reducing the amount of annotation needed to train deep learning systems.
I believe that making these systems interpretable could be the first step toward this goal.

I am currently working on visual grounding of textual information to:
+ Interpret and control machine predictions based on visual attention
+ Leverage human knowledge in textual domain to recognize unseen concepts

## News
+ All paper codes are released on [Github](https://github.com/hbdat).
+ Attended [virtual CVPR20](http://cvpr2020.thecvf.com/). Kudos to the organizers for pulling this off.
+ THREE papers, including an oral presentation, are accepted to CVPR 2020.
