## About Me

<img class="profile-picture" src="profile_pic.jpg">

Hi, I am a Ph.D. candidate at Khoury College of Computer Sciences, Northeastern University, advised by [Prof. Ehsan Elhamifar](https://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/eelhami/). 

I received my B.S. from University of Sciences (Viet Nam) where I was fortunate to study in Advanced Program in Computer Science. 

## Contact
If you are interested in my research or just want to say hi, I can be reached via:
+ Email: huynh [dot] dat [at] northeastern [dot] edu

## Research Interest
My main interest is on reducing the amount of annotation needed to train deep learning systems.
I am mesmerized by how much machines can learn with a few, one, or zero training sample(s).

I am currently working on:
+ Interpreting and controlling machine predictions via novel attention mechanisms
+ Leveraging human knowledge in textual domain to recognize unseen concepts
